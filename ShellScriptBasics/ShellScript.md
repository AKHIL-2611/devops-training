# Shell Script Basics:

### What is shell scripting :
* Shell scripting, in simple terms, is the process of writing and executing a series of commands in a sequence using a command-line shell. A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by typing text commands.

* In other words, shell scripting involves creating a script or program using commands that are understood by the shell (such as Bash, PowerShell, or others) to automate tasks, perform system operations, or run various programs. These scripts can be used to simplify repetitive tasks, manage files and directories, configure system settings, and much more.
