apiVersion: V1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-svc
spec:
  selector:
    name: nginx-svc
  type: NodePort
  ports:
      - port: 80
        targetPort: 80
        nodePort: 32000
```

* To publish ports , we have following types:
* ClusterIP: Exposes service on clusteripinternal address. Default type
* NodePort: If you want to expose the service on the node on which pod is running.
* Loadbalancer: Exposes the service externaly using cloud loadbalancers.

* Take an example from replicationController:
