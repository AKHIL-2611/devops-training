# Creating a cluster with kubeadm :
* For document [REFER HERE](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/)

# Steps to be done on master :
```
sudo su 
kubeadm init

You will be seiing the commands like below , when u run the above command:
==========================================================================
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a Pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  /docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
 =============================

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config 

```

## For weavenet to be installed on the master:
```
kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
```

## On all worker nodes :
```
You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
```

# After above steps ar done , connect to master and use below commands:
```
kubectl get nodes
```

## Working with k8s :
* We will be creating an image for our application to be running.
* The image created will be deployed to the k8s cluster, and we will be specifying he desired state.
* controller-manager will be taking care of our desired state.
* To access these pods we will be using service.
* We will be using volumes to be attached as persistent volumes.

* All the above things will be defined in a file called manifest file/deployment.yaml
