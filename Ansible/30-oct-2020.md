## Handler in ansible
* Handler also one of the module in ansible . It is mostly used to optimise the playbook.
* For Example 

```
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: installing apache2
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
      notify:
      - restart apache2
    - name: installing php modules
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present  
        update_cache: yes
      loop:
        - php
        - libapache2-mod-php
        - php-mysql
        - php-cli

    - name: creating the file info.php
      file:
        path: /var/www/html/info.php
        state: touch

    - name: add content to the info.php file
      blockinfile:
        path: /var/www/html/info.php
        block: |
          <?php
          phpinfo();
          ?>
      notify:
      - restart apache2 
    handlers:
      - name: restart apache2 
        service:
          name: apache2
          enabled: yes 
          state: restarted
```

## Jinja template
* These are used to create the dynamic files. DYnamic files means the content in the file will not be the static
* Example:
* Create a file with extension .j2 
```
vi   Testjinja.txt.j2

This is for the os { ansible_os_family }
This is of distribution { ansible_distribution }
```

## Reusability of ansible playbooks.
1. VARIABLES
2. IMPORT/INCLUDE
3. ANSIBLE ROLES

1. VARIABLES

```
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: installing software 
      apt:
        name: {{ package_name }}
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
```

```
ansible-plybook -i hosts -e package_name=git  playbook.yml
```
2. Import/Include
* java playbook (java.yml) 

```
- hosts: all
  become: yes 
  tasks: 
    - name: installing java 
      apt:
        name: openjdk-8-jdk
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
```


* Using the java playbook in installing tomcat8

```
- import_playbook: java.yml
- hosts: all
  become: yes 
  tasks: 
    - name: installing tomcat8
      apt:
        name: tomcat8
        state: present 
        update_cache: yes
    - name: copying the war file
      copy:
        src: /home/devops/SampleWebApp.war
        dest: /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/
    - name: restart the tomcat8
      service:
        name: tomcat8
        state: restarted
```

3. ANSIBLE ROLES:
* ANsible roles are the best way of reusing tje playbooks :
& We need to understand about the ansible-galaxy [REFER HERE](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)
