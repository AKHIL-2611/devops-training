kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: myfirstpod
spec:

* Pod are not the durable entities 
* To make sure the pods are running we will be using controllers.
* Pods will be having states of pending , Running , failed , sucess.
* Kubernetes will be having some probes inside the running container:
 * liveness probe
 * readiness probe
 * startup probe

## Init containers:
* These containers run before your main conatiner is going to start.
