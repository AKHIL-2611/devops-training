## k8s storages:
* In K8s , when ever the pod is deleted , the data produced by the pod is also deleted.
* Inorder to not having data loss , the concept of persistent volumes came in to picture.

* K8s gives us following ways of storage:
   * volumes
   * Persistent volumes
       * Persistent volume claims
       * storage classes
* In the volumes the behaviour is , whenever the pod is deleted the volume is also deleted.

# Persistent volume:
* To make persistent volume available to the pod , we need to follow below things:
   1. create a volume manually
   2. Make it available for the k8s (persistent volume)
   3. Make it available to the pod (persistent volume claims)

* we have two way of provisioning:
1. Static provisioning
2. Dynamic provisioning

## Static provisioning:
   1. create a volume manually
   2. Make it available for the k8s (persistent volume)
   3. Make it available to the pod (persistent volume claims)

## Dynamic provisioning:
   1. We will be creating storage class
   2. We will be claiming the persistent volume claim directly.



## Access modes to the volumes :
   * ReadWriteOnce
   * ReadOnlyMany
   * ReadWriteMany

* For Accesmodes [REFERHERE](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)


## Reclaim policy:
* If the persistent volume claim is deleted , what happens to your data :
* Reclaim policy :
   1. Retain
   2. Recycle
   3. Delete
