* As the containers are not reliable .That means the containers are going to stop/kill/died when there is no service running inside the container.
* When the containers are stopped the data inside the containers also lost.
* For the above isuue to be resolved , there is a concept of volumes, where we can attach the volumes. The volumes will be available even after the container is lost

## Volumes :
* volumes 
* Bind mount
* tmpfs
