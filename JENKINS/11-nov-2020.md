* JENKINS HOME DIRECTORY ---- _/var/lib/jenkins/_   
* whenever we are installing jenkins , a jenkins user is created.
![preview](../images/jenkins29.png)

* In jenkins home directory:
1. Allthe jobs we created on GUI will be stored at the path /var/lib/jekins/jobs

2. All info about  build and build number will be stored in path /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/<jobname>/builds . In config.xml we will have all the settings realted to the jenkins job.

* if the color of the ball is red , it is indicating that the job is failed.

* Running the jenkins job is nothing but building the jenkins.i,e build.
* A build number will be generated for every build triggered.
